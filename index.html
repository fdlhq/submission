            Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in
            1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield and
            drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of
            its career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive
            musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of
            thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's
            current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters
            Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and
            bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed
            Megadeth after being fired from Metallica, and bassists Ron
            McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the
            band.
          </p>

          <p>
            Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its
            third album, Master of Puppets (1986), which is cited as one of the
            heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next
            album, ...And Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its first
            Grammy Award nomination. Its fifth album, Metallica (1991), was a
            turning point for the band that saw them transition from their
            thrash roots; it appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving
            substantial commercial success and selling more than 16 million
            copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling
            album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different
            genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to
            its thrash metal roots with its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008),
            which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. The
            band's eleventh and most recent album, 72 Seasons, was released in
            2023.

          <h3>James Alan Hetfield</h3>
          <p>
            James Alan Hetfield (born August 3, 1963) is an American musician.
            He is the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, co-founder, and a primary
            songwriter of heavy metal band Metallica. He is mainly known for his
            intricate rhythm playing, but occasionally performs lead guitar
            duties and solos both live and in studio. Hetfield co-founded
            Metallica in October 1981 after answering an advertisement by
            drummer Lars Ulrich in the Los Angeles newspaper The Recycler.
            Metallica has won nine Grammy Awards and released 11 studio albums,
            three live albums, four extended plays, and 24 singles. Hetfield is
            often regarded as one of the greatest heavy metal rhythm guitar
            players of all time.
          </p>

          <h3>Lars Ulrich R</h3>
          <p>
            Lars Ulrich R (born 26 December 1963) is a Danish-American musician
            best known as the drummer and co-founder of American heavy metal
            band Metallica. The son and grandson respectively of tennis players
            Torben and Einer Ulrich, he played tennis in his youth and moved to
            Los Angeles at age 16 to train professionally. However, rather than
            playing tennis, Ulrich began playing drums. After publishing an
            advertisement in The Recycler, Ulrich met James Hetfield and formed
            Metallica. Along with Hetfield, Ulrich has songwriting credits on
            almost all of the band's songs, and the two of them are the only
            remaining original members of the band.
          </p>

          <h3>Kirk Lee Hammett</h3>
          <p>
            Kirk Lee Hammett (born November 18, 1962) is an American musician
            who has been the lead guitarist of heavy metal band Metallica since
            1983. Prior to joining Metallica, he co-formed the thrash metal band
            Exodus in 1979. In 2003, Hammett, along with bandmate James
            Hetfield, was ranked 23rd on Rolling Stone's list of Greatest
            Guitarists of All Time.[2] In 2009, Hammett was ranked number 15 in
            Joel McIver's book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists.

          <h3>Roberto Agustín Miguel</h3>
          <p>
            Roberto Agustín Miguel Santiago Samuel Trujillo Veracruz (born
            October 23, 1964) is an American musician who has been the bassist
            for heavy metal band Metallica since 2003. He first rose to
            prominence as the bassist of crossover thrash band Suicidal
            Tendencies from 1989 to 1995, while also collaborating with Suicidal
            Tendencies frontman Mike Muir for funk metal supergroup Infectious
            Grooves. After leaving Suicidal Tendencies, he performed with Ozzy
            Osbourne, Jerry Cantrell, and heavy metal band Black Label Society.
            Trujillo joined Metallica in 2003 and is the band's longest-serving
            bassist. He was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a
            member of Metallica in 2009.

            The discography of American heavy metal band Metallica includes 11
            studio albums, eight live albums, three extended plays, 44 singles,
            10 video albums, 43 music videos, one soundtrack album, one
            collaboration album and three box sets. They are a San
            Francisco-based metal band formed in 1981 by James Hetfield (lead
            vocals, rhythm guitar) and Lars Ulrich (drums). After several
            bassist and lead guitarist changes (including Dave Mustaine), the
            band settled on Cliff Burton and Kirk Hammett, respectively.
            Metallica started playing locally, releasing their first widely
            circulated demo, No Life 'til Leather, in 1982. The demo caught the
            attention of Johny Zazula, who signed Metallica to Megaforce
            Records. The band released Kill 'Em All in 1983, and the following
            year they released Ride the Lightning. After Ride the Lightning was
            released, Metallica left Megaforce and signed to Elektra Records. In
            March 1986, the band released its third studio album, Master of
            Puppets, which was Metallica's first album to be certified gold by
            the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). While
            promoting the album, Burton was killed in a bus accident. Jason
            Newsted was hired as a replacement. The band's first release to
            feature Newsted was The $5.98 E.P. Garage Days Re-Revisited, and
            then followed by ...And Justice for All in August 1988, which peaked
            at number six on the Billboard 200.
          </p>
          Metallica's fifth, self-titled album, often called The Black Album,
          was released in 1991 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.
          The band embarked on a two-year tour in support of the album.
          Metallica has since been certified 16 times platinum by the RIAA.
          Metallica followed with the release of Load and Reload,
          respectively.[5] After the release of Garage Inc. and S&M, Newsted
          (who would later join Voivod) departed from the band. Metallica
          recorded St. Anger without an official bassist (bass parts for the
          writing & recording during the album sessions were played by the
          band's long-time producer Bob Rock). Bassist Robert Trujillo joined
          Metallica in 2003. In 2008, the band released its ninth studio album,
          Death Magnetic, which was produced by Rick Rubin and distributed
          through Warner Bros. Records. In April 2009, the band's catalogue was
          released on the iTunes Store as the Metallica Collection.
          <p>
            In 2013, Metallica released the movie Metallica: Through the Never,
            together with its soundtrack. Metallica then started writing their
            tenth studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, which was
            released on November 18, 2016. On April 14th, 2023, Metallica
            released their eleventh studio album, titled 72 Seasons. Metallica
            has sold more than 125 million albums worldwide, with over 67
            million records in the United States alone (56.3 million albums
            since 1991 when SoundScan started tracking actual sales figures).
